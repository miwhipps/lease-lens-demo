- **File Format Detection:** PNG, JPEG, PDF header analysis
- **Textract Processing:** Operation selection, block analysis, response details
- **Text Extraction:** Line/word counts, confidence analysis, content preview
- **Lease Term Detection:** Automatic search for rent-related keywords

**Access:** CloudWatch logs with üîç DEBUG prefixed messages

### 4. Textract Extractor Debugging (`ocr_pipeline/textract_extract.py`)
**Location:** File processing methods

**Features:**
- **File Validation:** Existence checks, size analysis, extension detection
- **Processing Method:** PDF vs image processing paths
- **Error Handling:** Detailed error messages with fallback information
- **Multi-page Processing:** Page count and processing status

**Access:** Application logs with detailed processing information

### 5. Comprehensive Debug Display (`streamlit_app.py`)
**Location:** Persistent debug panel after processing

**Features:**
- **üìÅ File Information:** Original + temp file details, processing time
- **üîß OCR Engine Details:** Engine type, preprocessing status, OpenCV availability
- **üìä Extraction Results:** Characters, words, pages, confidence, word density
- **üîç Content Analysis:** Keyword detection, content flags, quality indicators
- **üî¨ AWS Textract Debug:** Raw Textract response analysis (when available)
- **üìù Text Preview:** Full extracted text with length information

**Access:** "üîç COMPREHENSIVE DEBUG INFORMATION" expandable panel

## How to Use for Troubleshooting

### Step 1: Check File Upload
1. Upload your document
2. Expand "üîç Debug: File Upload Details"
3. Verify:
   - File size is reasonable (not 0 bytes)
   - File type is correct (PDF/image)
   - Image preview displays correctly (for images)

### Step 2: Monitor OCR Processing
1. Click "üöÄ Process Document"
2. Watch the real-time debug output for:
   - OCR engine selection (Real Textract vs Mock)
   - File processing steps
   - Character/word extraction counts
   - Keyword detection results

### Step 3: Analyze Results
1. After processing, expand "üîç COMPREHENSIVE DEBUG INFORMATION"
2. Check:
   - **Extraction quality:** High character/word counts indicate good OCR
   - **Content flags:** Should see ‚úÖ for $ signs and numbers in lease documents
   - **Keyword detection:** Should find rent-related terms
   - **Text preview:** Manually verify extracted content looks correct

### Step 4: Check Lambda Logs (if using real Textract)
1. Go to AWS CloudWatch
2. Find your Lambda function logs
3. Look for üîç DEBUG messages showing:
   - File format detection
   - Textract block analysis
   - Extraction quality metrics

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: No text extracted (0 characters)
**Debug Steps:**
1. Check file upload section - is file size > 0?
2. Check OCR engine - is it using Mock vs Real Textract?
3. Check Lambda logs - any errors in Textract processing?
4. Check file format - is it a supported type?

### Issue: Wrong text extracted
**Debug Steps:**
1. Check image preview - does the preview look correct?
2. Check extraction preview - compare with expected content
3. Check preprocessing settings - try with/without OpenCV enhancement
4. Check confidence scores - low confidence indicates OCR issues

### Issue: Missing rent information
**Debug Steps:**
1. Check content analysis - are keywords being detected?
2. Check content flags - are $ signs and numbers present?
3. Check text preview - manually search for rent terms
4. Check chunking - rent info might be split across chunks

### Issue: Mock extractor being used instead of real Textract
**Debug Steps:**
1. Check OCR engine selection debug output
2. Check error details shown in debug panel
3. Verify AWS credentials are configured
4. Check Textract service availability in your region

## Debug Output Examples

### Successful Processing:
```
‚úÖ Successfully initialized: AWS Textract
‚Ä¢ Text extracted: 2,847 characters
‚Ä¢ Word count: 423 words
‚Ä¢ Confidence: 94.2%
‚Ä¢ Contains 'rent': True
‚Ä¢ Contains '$': True
‚úÖ Rent keywords found: rent, monthly, $, payment
```

### Problem Detection:
```
‚ùå No text was extracted from the document!
‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback to: Mock OCR (Demo)
‚ùå No rent keywords found! This indicates a potential OCR problem.
‚ùå NO TEXT EXTRACTED! This is a critical problem.
```

## Performance Monitoring

The debug system also tracks:
- **Processing time:** End-to-end document processing duration
- **File sizes:** Original vs temporary file size comparison
- **Word density:** Characters per word ratio (quality indicator)
- **Chunk distribution:** How text is split for vector storage

This comprehensive debugging system will help identify exactly where OCR extraction issues occur and provide actionable information for resolution.
