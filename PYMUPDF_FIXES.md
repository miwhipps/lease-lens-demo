# 🔧 PyMuPDF Document Closed Error Fixes

## Problem Solved
Fixed the "document closed" error that occurred during multi-page PDF processing with PyMuPDF, which was caused by improper document lifecycle management and resource cleanup.

## Root Cause Analysis
The original implementation had these issues:
1. **Document lifecycle**: Processed pages while document was still open, leading to timing issues
2. **Resource management**: No proper cleanup of pixmap and page objects
3. **Error propagation**: Single page failure would stop entire processing
4. **Memory leaks**: Temporary files and resources not properly cleaned up

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Document Lifecycle Management
**New Workflow:**
```
1. Open PDF document
2. Convert ALL pages to temporary image files  
3. Close PDF document immediately
4. Process each image file with OCR
5. Clean up all temporary files
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Document is closed before OCR processing begins
- No more "document closed" errors
- Proper separation of PDF conversion and OCR processing

### 2. Proper Resource Cleanup
**Implementation:**
```python
def _process_pdf_with_pymupdf(self, file_path):
    doc = None
    page_images = []
    
    try:
        # Process pages
        doc = fitz.open(file_path)
        page_images = self._convert_pdf_pages_to_images(doc, len(doc))
        doc.close()
        doc = None  # Mark as closed
        
        return self._process_page_images(page_images)
        
    finally:
        # Always ensure cleanup
        if doc is not None:
            doc.close()
        self._cleanup_temp_images(page_images)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Finally blocks**: Ensure resources are always cleaned up
- **Explicit null assignment**: Clear references after closing
- **Temp file management**: Automatic cleanup of all generated files

### 3. Individual Page Error Handling
**Graceful Failure:**
```python
def _process_page_images(self, page_images):
    for i, image_path in enumerate(page_images):
        try:
            # Process this page
            page_result = self.extract_text_from_image(image_bytes)
            # Add to results
        except Exception as e:
            # Log error but continue with other pages
            all_text += f"\n--- Page {page_num} ---\n[OCR failed: {str(e)}]\n"
            continue
```

**Benefits:**
- Single page failures don't stop entire document
- Partial results are still returned
- Clear indication of which pages failed

### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging
**Comprehensive Tracking:**
```python
logger.info(f"🔍 DEBUG: Opening PDF document: {file_path}")
logger.info(f"🔍 DEBUG: Document has {total_pages} pages")
logger.info("🔍 DEBUG: Closing PDF document after image conversion")
logger.info(f"🔍 DEBUG: Multi-page processing complete:")
logger.info(f"🔍 DEBUG:   Successful pages: {successful_pages}")
```

## Files Modified

### 1. requirements.txt
**Added:**
```
PyMuPDF
```

### 2. ocr_pipeline/textract_extract.py
**New Methods Added:**

#### `_process_pdf_with_pymupdf(file_path)`
- Main orchestrator for PyMuPDF processing
- Handles document lifecycle and error recovery

#### `_convert_pdf_pages_to_images(doc, total_pages)`
- Converts all PDF pages to temporary image files
- Immediate resource cleanup per page

#### `_process_page_images(page_images)`
- Processes each image file with OCR
- Handles individual page failures gracefully

#### `_cleanup_temp_images(page_images)`
- Removes all temporary image files
- Logs cleanup operations for debugging

## Error Scenarios Handled

### 1. Document Closed Error
**Before:**
```
Document closed error during page processing
```
**After:**
```
✅ Document closed immediately after page conversion
✅ OCR processing happens on saved image files
```

### 2. Partial Page Failures
**Before:**
```
Single page failure stops entire document processing
```
**After:**
```
✅ Individual page failures logged and skipped
✅ Remaining pages continue processing
✅ Partial results returned with clear indicators
```

### 3. Resource Leaks
**Before:**
```
Temporary files and resources not cleaned up
```
**After:**
```
✅ Automatic cleanup in finally blocks
✅ All temporary files removed
✅ Clear logging of cleanup operations
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ PyMuPDF installed and functional
- ✅ New methods properly integrated
- ✅ Document lifecycle management implemented
- ✅ Resource cleanup verified
- ✅ Error handling tested

## Debug Output Example
